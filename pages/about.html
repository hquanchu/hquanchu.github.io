  I'm a Cloud Engineer based in Koblenz, Germany with a strong focus on building scalable, secure and reliable cloud solutions!<br>
  <br>My experience spans cloud platforms, primarily Microsoft Azure, as well as infrastructure-as-code with Terraform, CI/CD pipelines and containerization.<br>
  <br>
  <br>Outside of work, I enjoy going to the gym, cooking and playing board games with friends ( ദ്ദി ˙ᗜ˙ )
